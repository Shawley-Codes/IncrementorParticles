1.The project I will be working on will be an incrementor game. The gameplay works by clicking buttons to increase numbers, and certain other numbers will do different things. The gameplay will mostly take place with a hud with a canvas that has a visualization of numbers and different menus that will appear over time. As a stretch goal the visualization will have a storyline. 
2. Week 1: Design the hud and create the basic click to increment system.
Week 2: Create the rest of the hud and how numbers work
Week 3: Work on functionality, like hiding hud elements till they are avaliable
Week 4: Work on visualization screen, so that numbers are simulated
Week 5: Polish work and attempt stretch goal
3. I will create a web based application using idflood ThreeNodes.js
